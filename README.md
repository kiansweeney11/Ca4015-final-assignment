# CA4015 Assignment 3/4

## Kian Sweeney / 18306226

Project repo for assignment 3/4 for CA4015: Advanced Machine Learning. In 
this we attempt to build a recommendation system.

## Challenges
Please note I had issues when trying to create a Jupyter book. Anytime I tried
to run the ghp-import command it would do nothing. I spent extensive time trying to
fix this but to no avail.

## Files to be viewed
- intro.ipynb = simple outline of the assignment.
- recommender.ipynb = contains all work regarding data cleaning, visualization,
recommender systems and clustering work.
- conclus.ipynb = simple concluding comments on the assignment and scope for
future work.

Note: recommender-past.ipynb is another system I was going to try but time constraints
meant I couldn't give it the necessary time. Not entirely necessary to view.
